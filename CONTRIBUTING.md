# Contributing

We appreciate the help. You're the best. üëç

## 1. Check out the [Issue Tracker](/../../issues)

Maybe we're already fixing the issue. If not...

## 2. Start a discussion with a contributor

Where does your contribution fit into our timeline? Is it a bug other people are seeing? Is it a feature other people want? Let's figure it out together.

## 3. Make a contribution

We try to keep contribution pretty consistent across our repositories. Give these a quick read and report back!
