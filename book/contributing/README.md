## Contribution Checklist

### 1. Report an Issue

Check and see if we're already tracking the issue on the Issue Tracker for the repo in question. If it's not an open Issue, start a quick discussion in the Gitter Room for the project. Both the Issue Tracker and Gitter Room can be found in the `README.md` of the repo.

### 2. Fork, Clone, and Install

This should be covered in the Install, Usage, and Development instructions listed in the repo's `README` file.

### 3. Implement Your Fix or Feature

Write your code!

### 4. Run Tests and Format Your Code

Again, this should be covered in the Install, Usage, and Development instructions listed in the repo's `README` file.

### 5. Make a Pull Request

Open a Pull Request again the repo's `master` branch. You'll notice there's a Checklist prepopulated in the description. Once that checklist is complete and the maintainers are satisfied with the changes, your code will be merged and planned for release. Congratulations!
